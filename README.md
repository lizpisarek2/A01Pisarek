This was an assignment for Developing Web Apps and Services. I kind of turned it into a future personal website idea. It has HOME, ABOUT, and CONTACT page. Each of these pages go into more detail about me. The ABOUT me page even includes a human to dog years calculator.

Getting Started:

  - Include a profile photo (img-circle).
  - Include a second image.
  - Include an an embedded video.
  - Use at least 15 different HTML tags.
  - Add at least 6 CSS selectors, 2 that style by element, 2 by id, and 2 by class.
  - Include at least 3 pages: Home / YourChoice / Contact.
  - Use a nicely styled Bootstrap Navbar.
  - On your YourChoice, you will use JavaScript to calculate something in response to user inputs. 
  - On Contact page, draft a contact form so users can say hello or ask you a question.
  - Include links to your GitHub site, your BitBucket site, your LinkedIn account.
  - Add a simple README.md file or README.txt to your folder
